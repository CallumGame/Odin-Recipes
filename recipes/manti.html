    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This manti recipe takes a little time to prepare, but I'm sure you'll agree it's worth it! Manti is a famous meal from my country. Afiyet olsun</p>
    
    <p>Manti are traditional Turkish dumplings filled with spiced ground meat and onions. The dumplings are most commonly topped with a sauce consisting of yogurt and garlic. The name of the dish is derived from mantu, meaning dumplings, and they were originally brought over from Central Asia to Turkey by nomadic Turkish tribes in the 13th century.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>   
        <li> 2 onions, peeled</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.</li>   
        <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle, as thin as you can. Cut into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.        </li>
        <li>Place about 2 teaspoons meat filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking</li>
        <li>Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm. Stir together yogurt and minced garlic in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle each serving with warm red pepper oil.</li>
