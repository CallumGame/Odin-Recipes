<h2>Description</h2>

<p>a dish consisting of beef coated in pâté and wrapped in puff pastry.</p>

<p>Beef Wellington is a nice cut of meat, usually a fillet steak, beef tenderloin or filet mignon. It is the center cut portion of the meat that is known to be the most tender and juicy part of the cow. This decadent meat is sometimes on the pricy side and is made for special occasions or holidays.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>

<li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin</li>
<li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
<li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
<li>2 ounces liver pate</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
<li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
<li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
<li>>2 tablespoons red wine</li>

</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>

<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
<li>Place beef tenderloin in a small baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over beef.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan; allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.</li>
<li>ncrease oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
<li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
<li>Mix together paté and 2 tablespoons softened butter in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.</li>
<li>Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center. Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
<li>Place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.</li>
